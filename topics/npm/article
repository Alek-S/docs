*weird work in-progress*

npm, short for node package manager, is a super useful tool that installs packages, updates packages, and manage dependencies. A plethora of node.js libraries and applications are published on npm. These applications can be searched for on <http://search.npmjs.org/>. Once you have a package you want to install, it can be installed with a single commmand which is handy for a node.js developer. 

Use case: Install a library
===========================
Let's say you are writing your program and you decide you need to use a library, for example: `underscore`. Thankfully npm is very simple to use, so all you have The commandline usage of npm is super simple. You can run `npm install <package>` to install the package in the current directory. So you run this at the root of your project, so `require` can find the libraries.

If you want globally install the package, you run `npm install <package> -g`. *research the precise differences between global and local. it appears as if when require can not find globally installed packages

Another way to use npm is when you have a node project with a package.json <link to package.json explanation> file. You can run `npm install` and npm will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json. This makes it installing from a git repo much easier!

Example:
git clone ...
cd dir/
npm install




npm can also be used programmatically.
