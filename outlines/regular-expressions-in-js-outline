# How do I use Regular Expressions in Node.js/Javascript?

Node implements the same built-in Regular Expression methods as standard JavaScript, which can be quite useful for string matching.  

- Describe the `RegExp()` Object and its constructor, implicit and explicit instatiation, both static and dynamic.
- Describe the evils of the need to double-escape regular strings passed into the `RegExp()` constructor.
- Mention Evil Regexes briefly when mentioning dynamic regexes.
- Some Regular Expression functions are String methods; others are RegExp methods.
  - String.match(RegExp) - Tests `RegExp` against the provided string, and returns an array of results.
  - Describe the RegExp.test(string) method - returns a matched/not matched boolean.
  - RegExp.exec(string) - pretty much the same as String.match(RegExp)
  - String.replace()
    - Basic syntax - myString.replace(/re/, 'replacement')
    - Replacement with backreferences ($1, $2, $`, $', etc.)
    - Replacement by callback
- Describe what JS Regex doesn't do - no lookbehind, no atomic grouping, no named capture groups, no conditionals
- Maybe mention a situation where using regex would be a bad idea
