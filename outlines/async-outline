# How to deal with Asynchronous code

Javascript is an asynchronous language, in contrast to many synchronous languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl, C, etc.  There are a number of important things to be aware of if you don't want your code to execute in extremely unexpected ways.

- Examples of when asynchrnonicity becomes important
- "The For Loop problem" - JS scope vs. asynchronicity
  - This:

     for (var i=0; i < 5; i++) {
       console.log(i);
     }

  - versus:

     for (var i=0; i < 5; i++) {
       (function (i) {
         console.log(i);  
       })(i);
     }

- Callbacks - definition, and good-practice examples
