# How to search directories for files in Node.js

Let's take a look at how to search for a given file in a directory, or a tree of directories.

- First, fs.readdir() example.  Maybe include a Pro Tip about callbacks or file i/o.
- Mention a case with complex recursion, then segue into findit.

[Node-findit](https://github.com/substack/node-findit), by SubStack, is a helper module to make searching for files easier.  It has interfaces to let you work with callbacks, events, or just plain old synchronously, as you prefer.

Callback:

     require('findit').find(__dirname, function (file) {
       console.log(file);
     });

Events:

     var finder = require('findit').find(__dirname);

     finder.on('directory', function (dir) {
       console.log(dir + '/');
     });

     finder.on('file', function (file) {
       console.log(file);
     });

Old School (Synchronously):

     var files = require('findit').sync(__dirname);
     console.dir(files);
