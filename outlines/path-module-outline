# How to use the path module

Node.js provides a built-in module called `path`, which provides shortcuts for a number of tasks relating to working with pathnames.

***NOTE: this will need to be reviewed when Windows support stabilizes - changes are very possible where '/' vs. '\' is concerned, etc.

- Start with path.exists() and path.existsSync() - the latter returns a bool and blocks, the former takes a callback and does not.
- path.normalize() - Strip `.`, `..`, and doubled slashes from the given path, adjusting it appropriately.
- path.resolve() - Resolves a list of paths - this behaves something like a sequence of `cd` commands in the shell, except it also sorts out non-existent paths, resolving all provided into one valid path.  (Not beginner? I can't tell.)
- path.dirname() - Strips the filename from a path.  
- path.basename() - Just returns the filename. Pass in '/home/user/file.txt', and it returns 'file.txt'; '/home/user/file.txt', '.txt' would just return 'file'.  (The second argument is an optional extension.)
- path.extname() - returns the extension, i.e. everything after the last '.'.
- path.join() - Join all arguments together and normalize the resulting path.
