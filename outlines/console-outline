# What is the `console` object?

Anyone familiar with browser-side development has probably used `console.log` for debugging purposes - Node.js has implemented a built-in `console` object to mimic much of this functionality, except with `stdout`, `stdin`, and `stderr` instead of the browser's debugging console.

- The `console` object is a convenience object implemented to wrap basic `stdout` and `stderr` functionality in a way similar to the way one would perform such output in a browser.
- console.log() - basic output - alias console.info() - accepts `printf`-style format strings - calls `util.inspect` on object args
- console.dir() - alias for `util.inspect`, enumerates object properties 
- console.error() - prints output to stderr.  Maybe not that useful compared to something like `new Error()`

Might be worth describing console.error, console.warn, console.time, console.assert - but maybe not
