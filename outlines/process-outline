# The built-in Process object

This article should describe Node's `process` object, and its many and varied uses to the beginning Node.js developer.

- The `process` object is a module containing functionality for interacting with the current Node process.
- Events: on 'exit', on 'uncaughtException'
  - on exit: perform {} before the program exits
  - on uncaughtException: if an exception bubbles all the way up, fire this.  Useful for long-running processes; discuss pitfalls.
- process.stdin/stdout/stderr - access to readable/writeable standard input/output/error streams.  Should likely link to 'stream' articles.
- process.argv - Link to command-line argument parsing article.
- process.execPath, process.cwd - Discuss execPath vs. current working directory
- process.chdir() - change directories
- process.env - access to environment variables
- process.version/pid/title/platform - various process info
- process.nextTick?  Likely advanced, the above should be fine.
