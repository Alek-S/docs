# How to use the Node.js REPL


Node.js ships with a REPL, which is short for 'Read-Eval-Print Loop'.  You can think of it like a Node.js shell - it executes Javascript for you, and you can access all of Node's built-in modules, as well as require your own for testing and debugging purposes.  

- The Node REPL is a command interpreter - you can feed it JS
- Good for testing and experimentation
- Discuss REPL idiosyncrasies: `var x = 5` sets a value, `x = 5` sets and returns it; etc.
- Give a use case or two
